# homeirrigation
Python project to run irrigation system on timers for Raspberry PI

Currently I have the UI as on/off/auto buttons to control each irrigation zone. I am struggling with creating a new tKinter window that opens when user clicks "..." and displays a schedule to turn on/off each zone.

The buttons don't actually do anything yet, but they will control a relay switch that will open/close a  solenoid that will be triggered from the GPIO on the raspberry PI.

I would love some help with this, so if you can jump in, please fork!
